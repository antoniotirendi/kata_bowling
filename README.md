Using the OCP rules, write a calculator for scores in ten-pin bowling.

And here are some bonus variants:
- In Martian bowling there are 12 frames, with 3 rolls per frame. 
  All other rules are unchanged.

- In the Callisto variant, the rules are as for normal (Earth) bowling,
  except as long as the last roll is a 10 you may keep on rolling.
  
- In Venusian rules the number of pins starts at 1 for the first frame,
  and increased by 1 for each subsequent frame.
  All other rules as per Earth bowling.
  
- The Venusian rules may be applied to all other variants
  ... in any combination.
